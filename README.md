# Blog Poster

**NOTE: This project is still in progress**

**Latest update: Implemented basic authentication with username/password.**

BlogPoster is a social media platform with the focus on user content. It provides users with the
ability to create posts using markdown, and interact with others through follow and like counts.

This project is developed using NextJS and Tailwind for design. There is a Docker image for the
PostgresSQL database used to store everything and Prisma is used as an ORM. Authentication is done
using Lucia because of more flexibility.
